New features:
- Added support for torch.nn.InstanceNorm1d, torch.nn.InstanceNorm2d and torch.nn.InstanceNorm3d
- Fixed issue with torch.nn.GroupNorm where only 4-dimensional inputs could be used
- Replaced Adam with AdamW optimizer.
- Added support for the following loss functions:
    torch.nn.KLDivLoss, torch.nn.PoissonNLLLoss, torch.nn.HingeEmbeddingLoss, torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss, torch.nn.SmoothL1Loss, torch.nn.SoftMarginLoss, torch.nn.MultiLabelSoftMarginLoss, torch.nn.CosineEmbeddingLoss, torch.nn.MarginRankingLoss, torch.nn.TripletMarginLoss
- Added support for torch.optim.RMSprop optimizer
- Added support for bool inputs to modelsÂ§
- Improved support for half type models and inputs.
    Using a mix of float 16 and float 32 inputs is now supported. Please see
    the documentation for cases in which a model might use different types
    compared to when run natively with PyTorch.
- Added support for serialized matrix multiplications
(poptorch.serializedMatMul)

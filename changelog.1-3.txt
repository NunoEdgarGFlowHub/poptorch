New features:
- PopTorch now exposes PopART anchor options to choose how much data to return from a model. These
are passed into the model wrapper via |anchor_mode| options are Sum, All, Final and EveryN.
    All: Return a result for each batch.
    Sum: Return the sum of all the batches
    Final: Return the last batch.
    EveryN: Return every N batches. N is passed in as |anchor_return_period|

- Add support for batched LSTM and batch first

- An Options object can now be passed to poptorch.trainingModel / poptorch.inferenceModel to configure the session and select IPUs

- Adds support for the torch comparisons operations:
    torch.eq, torch.ge, torch.gt,
    torch.le, torch.lt, torch.max,
    torch.min, torch.ne, torch.isnan

    torch.min and torch.max only support (tensor, tensor) and (tensor) overloads. They do
    not support the (tensor, dim=, keepdim=) overload.

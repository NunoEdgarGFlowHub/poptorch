are passed into the model wrapper via |anchor_mode| options are "SUM", "ALL", "FINAL" and "EVERYN".
    "ALL" : Return a result for each batch.
    "SUM" : Return the sum of all the batches
    "FINAL" : Return the last batch.
    "EVERYN" : Return every N batches. N is passed in as |anchor_return_period|
- Add support for batched LSTM and batch first

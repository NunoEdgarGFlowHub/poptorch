Introduction
------------

PopTorch is a set of extensions for PyTorch to enable it to run on the Graphcore
IPU hardware.

By wrapping a PyTorch model in a PopTorch wrapper, the model
can be trained on the IPU, and then saved or inspected as a PyTorch
model. It can also be used for making predictions on IPU hardware.
